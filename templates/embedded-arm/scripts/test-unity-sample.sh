echo "üéØ LEARNING POINTS:"
echo "1. Unity uses simple C macros for assertions"
echo "2. Manual mocks provide fine-grained control"
echo "3. Lightweight framework suitable for embedded systems"
echo "4. Different approach compared to Google Test"
echo "5. No complex dependencies - easy to integrate"
echo
echo "üìö For production use, consider the main Google Test environment"
echo "   which provides more features and VSCode integration."
